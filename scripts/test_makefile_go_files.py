"""Prove GO_FILES excludes nested worktrees, and that the exclusion is what does it.

Peer worktrees live under .worktrees/ inside the project. A bare `find .` walks into
them, which made `make fmt-check` fail on another agent's in-progress files and made
`make fmt` rewrite them. See #560.

Each behaviour here is proved against a synthetic offender created for the test, and
the central claim carries a removal proof that varies exactly one thing: the same find
command with and without the exclusion clause.
