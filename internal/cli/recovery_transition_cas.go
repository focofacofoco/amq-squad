// PR5 / #498 CAS layer. Three durable publications -- RESERVE, BIND, CONSUME -- each going
// through publishGoalJSON, the one CAS owner (goal_attempt.go:152). There is no new store and no
// new primitive here; this file only decides WHAT is published and WHAT a lost race means.
//
// THE PUBLICATION PRIMITIVE IS link(2), NOT O_EXCL. publishGoalJSON writes a same-directory
// candidate, fsyncs it, and link(2)s it into the canonical path: losers see ErrExist and can never
// observe a partial file. I had assumed O_EXCL and written an enforcement test against that
// assumption; it would have detected nothing here. Recorded so the next reader does not repeat it.
//
// THE THREE PUBLICATIONS DO NOT SHARE LOST-RACE SEMANTICS, and that asymmetry is the whole reason
// this is not one generic helper. Read from the existing redelivery code before writing this:
//
//	RESERVE  !published -> REFUSE. Another actor holds the claim. This is claim-once.
//	BIND     !published -> RE-READ AND VALIDATE, not refuse. A binding may legitimately already
//	         exist from this same actor's earlier attempt; what matters is that the existing one
//	         AGREES about the launch generation. Refusing here would break the idempotent retry
//	         that ensureResumeGoalTransitionBinding relies on (resume_goal.go:954-967).
//	CONSUME  !published -> REFUSE. A concurrent consumption means someone else completed the
//	         delivery, and two consumptions of one claim is the double-delivery signature.
//
// A single "publish or fail" helper across all three would look like a simplification and would
// silently convert bind's legitimate idempotence into a hard failure on every retry. The
// uniformity is the bug, not the duplication.

// recoveryReservation pairs the record with the EXACT path it was published to.
//
// The path comes from newRecoveryTransitionRecord and is never recomputed here. A reserver that
// derived its own path would be a second path owner, and a claim written where no scanner looks
// exists on disk while blocking nothing -- the r6 failure at the container level.
