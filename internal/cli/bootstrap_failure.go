// Bootstrap-failure surfacing (#540).
//
// The launch that produced #540 spawned three panes, printed
//
//	Added 3 team pane(s) to current tmux window. started v2-25-0 using profile squad
//
// and exited as if it had succeeded. All three agents had in fact died on their
// first command, each leaving an `error: ...` line and a shell prompt in its
// pane. The only signal the operator got was a later, unrelated-looking
// "lead role \"cto\" did not become ready within 45s".
//
// The launcher can read those panes, so it must: an agent that died at bootstrap
// is a launch failure, and the pane's own error text is the diagnostic. This
// file turns pane content into a member-attributed failure.

// paneErrorLineRE matches the error line an amq-squad or agent bootstrap failure
// leaves on screen. The set is deliberately tight -- an anchored `error:` /
// `fatal:` / `panic:` at the start of a line -- so ordinary agent output that
// merely discusses an error does not read as a dead pane.

// bootstrapFailureTailLines is how much of each pane to inspect. A bootstrap
// error is the last thing printed before the shell prompt, so the tail is where
// it is.
//
// PRECONDITION: reading a fixed-size tail assumes the pane contains ONLY output
// from this launch. That holds today because every agent pane is created within
// the launch operation itself, and the session-reuse branches do NOT weaken it:
// AllowExistingSession reuses the SESSION, not a pane, so reuseExistingSession
// skips the first-target block and every agent still gets a fresh split/window.
// The only pane ever reused for an agent is a session-initial pane created
// microseconds earlier in the same operation.
//
// If an agent is ever placed into a PRE-EXISTING pane, this probe needs a
// scrollback fence: mark the pane before dispatch and read only past the mark.
// Without one it could attribute a stale anchored error line from unrelated
// earlier output to this launch and fail a healthy spawn.

// Probe pacing. The budget bounds only the INCONCLUSIVE case: a healthy launch

// the first pane is confirmed dead, so neither normally pays the full budget.
//
// Known cost, accepted: a MIXED roster, where some panes report their engine and
// others cannot be inspected at all, never reaches either early-return condition
// and so pays the whole budget before failing open. It is bounded, it only
// delays a launch rather than failing it, and the alternative (failing open as
