// Bootstrap-failure surfacing (#540).
//
// The launch that produced #540 spawned three panes, printed
//
//	Added 3 team pane(s) to current tmux window. started v2-25-0 using profile squad
//
// and exited as if it had succeeded. All three agents had in fact died on their
// first command, each leaving an `error: ...` line and a shell prompt in its
// pane. The only signal the operator got was a later, unrelated-looking
// "lead role \"cto\" did not become ready within 45s".
//
// The launcher can read those panes, so it must: an agent that died at bootstrap
// is a launch failure, and the pane's own error text is the diagnostic. This
// file turns pane content into a member-attributed failure.

// paneErrorLineRE matches the error line an amq-squad or agent bootstrap failure
// leaves on screen. The set is deliberately tight -- an anchored `error:` /
// `fatal:` / `panic:` at the start of a line -- so ordinary agent output that
// merely discusses an error does not read as a dead pane.
