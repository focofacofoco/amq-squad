// The loader must pass THE PROJECTION'S digest to the predicate -- the value returned by
// preparedRunManifestForProjection -- and not one derived from the launch record. A
// record-derived digest makes the comparison self-referential: the token is checked against a
// snapshot built from its own field, so it always agrees and Bindable is true for a superseded
// generation.
//
// Pinned structurally because the behavioural falsifier is impossible: the fixture would need
// one generation id published twice with different content, and publishPreparedRunGeneration
// installs generation artifacts with os.Link, which fails EEXIST rather than replacing. Same
// reasoning as the admission inertness pin -- when a property cannot be given a falsifying
// INPUT, give it a falsifying EDIT.
