// Launch-attempt evidence for the doctor bootstrap row (#598 root cause 3).
//
// doctor reported `bootstrap/<role>: no launch record; skipped` as OK even when
// a launch had just been attempted for that role and the agent had died. During
// the fresh-namespace brick that made doctor report every row ok while the
// namespace was unusable, so no sanctioned diagnostic surfaced the cause.
//
// Turning that row into a failure needs a predicate, because plenty of members
// legitimately have no launch record: never launched, staged but not started,
// an external lead adopted in a pane amq-squad did not spawn. Failing those
// would make doctor noisy for people who did nothing wrong, which is its own
// way of hiding a real problem.
//
// The predicate is the prepared launch RESERVATION. A reservation is durable,
// positive proof that a launch was reserved for this exact namespace and
// generation. No reservation means nothing was attempted and silence is honest.
// A reservation means silence is a lie.

// preparedLaunchAttemptEvidence is the proof that a launch was reserved for a
// namespace, and where that proof lives so the operator can go look at it.

// readPreparedRunManifest, and that is deliberate rather than a shortcut.
// readPreparedRunManifest resolves the CURRENT pointer and validates manifest
// and state digests, so it fails whenever preparation has drifted -- which is
// precisely the #598 situation this row exists to report. Depending on it would
// make the escalation go silent exactly when it matters most, reintroducing the
// defect one layer down. The roster is only used to SCOPE the failure to
// accepted members, never as authority, so an unvalidated read is the right
// tool: it answers "was this member part of the launch that was reserved" from
// the launch that was actually reserved.

// An unreadable generation manifest yields no roles, which collapses the
