// way to them. W4, W6 and W2 all SURVIVED the first mutation run: the corresponding properties
// were asserted in prose, in file headers and in commit messages, and nowhere in a test.
//
// W4 is the one worth remembering. Bind's re-read-and-validate on a lost race is the finding I
// called the most consequential of the milestone; I wrote three paragraphs on why collapsing the
// three publications into one uniform helper would break it -- and making bind refuse on
// !published failed nothing. I documented the property and never pinned it. A comment is not a
// test, and being pleased with an insight is not evidence for it.

// W4: bind is the ONE publication of the three where a lost race is NOT a failure.
//
// BOTH DIRECTIONS, deliberately: a bind that refused everything would satisfy a
// refuses-on-change test alone, and a bind that accepted everything would satisfy an
// idempotent-retry test alone. Only the pair pins the actual contract.

// purely structural and pinned it with a reflection check on recoveryTransitionInput's DIRECT
// field names.

// resumeGoalTransitionRecord, and that type HAS a TransitionID field. So the smuggling channel
// exists TODAY as Base.TransitionID; the direct-field pin sees only "Base" and never descends, so
// it passed while the hole it named was open. The old test's own NAME asserted something untrue.
//
// And the mutation was never inert: it is inert only for the production callers I happened to
// look at. A test is a caller, and future production callers are exactly what a pin is for. "No
// input can express this" was a conclusion I reached without trying to construct one.
