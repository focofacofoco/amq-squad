// TestPrepareAndPaneRenderTheSameRoster is the #618 staged-roster regression.
//
// THE ORIGINAL DEFECT. The routing block was produced by two call sites that each
// chose the roster themselves, with two different functions:
//
//	prepare-time  run_start_readiness.go  bootstrapCurrentTeamForTeam(rec, tm)
//	              where tm was narrowed by partitionPreparedRunMembers
//	              = filterMembersBySession MINUS staged roles
//	pane-time     launch.go               bootstrapCurrentTeamWithRoster(rec, teamHome, true)
//	              = team.ReadProfile + filterMembersBySession, staged roles NOT removed
//
// With a non-empty staged roster the pane render carried members the accepted
// render did not, so every bootstrap row drifted at once.
//
// WHY THIS TEST ASSERTS AT THE RENDERER, NOT AT THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS. It first
// compared bootstrapCurrentTeamForTeam against bootstrapCurrentTeamWithRoster
// directly. After the fix, the pane no longer CALLS the second one for a prepared
// launch, so that comparison would have kept failing while the shipped behaviour
// was correct -- a test asserting a proxy for the outcome instead of the outcome.
// It now drives launchBootstrapPrompt, the renderer the pane actually uses, and
// asserts the property that matters: with staged members present, the pane prompt
// must digest to exactly what preparation accepted.

// exactSessionRoster stat (dead on all three prepared paths), role/launch
// ExistingPath (same string in both reachable cases), timestamps (#598's
// determinism test passes and a clock input would drift EVERY render), the
// amq env root_id/base_root_id delta (real, but discarded by the amqEnv
// unmarshal), and the staged projection plus execution-contract roster width
// (both no-ops when nothing is staged).
//
// WHAT SURVIVES: routeExplainCommand (bootstrap.go:595-603) shells out to
// `amq route explain --json` ONCE PER PEER and splices the result verbatim into
// that peer's send: line. Its answer depends on the AMQ root and the peer
// mailboxes actually existing. Preparation runs before they do; `agent up`
// re-renders after. That is the last live-state input inside the render.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT rc1_bisect's EXCLUDED DELTA 3: that fixture materializes the
// agent extension directory, role.md and launch.json, but never initializes AMQ
// MAILBOXES. `amq route explain` does not care about role.md; it cares about
// mailbox structure under the root. So delta 3 crossed a different boundary than
// the one the send: lines actually depend on, and its exclusion does not cover
// this. Stated explicitly so this is not read as re-deriving settled evidence.
//
// Reports the diff rather than asserting a shape: if the differing lines are
// send: lines, mechanism 2 is found. If the diff is EMPTY, mechanism 2 is not a
// render input at all and the fix design has to look at what "accepted" bytes
// were persisted versus re-derived, which is decisive either way.

// launch.go:697-701 builds the context with bootstrapContextFor and then

// overrides FIVE (CurrentTeam+Warnings, Execution, ActorExecution, PlannerLead,

// hand-built to mirror preparedBootstrap's construction, and it does not mirror

//   - the CWD spelling (/var vs /private/var): preparedBootstrap runs
//     canonicalDir on the member cwd; this rec does not.
//   - relative vs absolute AMQ root in the role/launch paths: preparedBootstrap
//     takes root from resolveAMQEnvForTeamLaunchProfile; this rec sets it directly.
//   - "native_goal" vs "native_goal_missing": preparedBootstrap sets
//     rec.GoalBinding for the lead; this rec leaves it empty.
//
// NOT the test's fault, and the reason this test exists: the routing block
// collapsing to "send: unavailable" in the ACCEPTED prompt. That comes from
// bootstrapCurrentTeamForTeam comparing samePath(rec.CWD, m.EffectiveCWD(...))
// where run_start_readiness.go:1103 resolved one side through canonicalDir and
// bootstrap.go:493 left the other raw. That asymmetry is real code and holds
