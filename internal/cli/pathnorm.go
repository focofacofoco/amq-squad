// Path representation normalization.
//
// GitHub #539 and #540 were the same defect twice: a filesystem path recorded
// in one representation and compared in another. #540 recorded `--project` as
// the literal "." in the prepared manifest while resolving it absolutely at
// bootstrap, so an identity tuple compared unequal and rendered an error whose
// two operands were byte-identical. #539 was the same relative project leaking
// one level further, into `tool_policy_sources`: those entries are built with
// filepath.Join(project, ...), so a relative project produced a relative
// project-local entry that the spawn-time comparator then saw as a changed
// capability source set.
//
// The fix is that there is exactly one canonicalization function and both the
// recorder and every comparator call it. Adding a second normalizer anywhere
// re-opens this class of bug, so route new path comparisons through
// canonicalFilesystemPath rather than hand-rolling Abs/Clean/EvalSymlinks.

// There are two normalization levels on purpose, and the split matters.
//
// RECORDING uses absoluteFilesystemPath: tilde-expanded, absolute, cleaned, but
// NOT symlink-resolved. Recorded paths stay the location the operator named.
// Resolving symlinks at record time would rewrite `/var/folders/...` to
// `/private/var/folders/...` on macOS, changing user-visible output and every
// digest computed over the path, which is a different behavior change than the
// one #539/#540 ask for.
//
// COMPARISON uses canonicalFilesystemPath, which additionally resolves
// symlinks. Representation-independence of an identity is a property of the
// comparison, not of the stored bytes: a symlinked path and its target are the
// same location and must compare equal however each side was recorded.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION: tool_policy_sources records canonically. That field
// exists only to be compared, is never echoed back as an operator-chosen path,
// and has two writers that derive the project from different origins (cwd vs
// team.json), so absolute-only recording made them disagree byte-for-byte. See
// the comment at its assignment in team_overlay.go. Prefer the record/compare
// split for anything new; do not widen this exception without the same
// justification.

// absoluteFilesystemPath is the RECORDING normalization: tilde-expanded,
// absolute, and lexically cleaned. This is what turns `--project .` into a
// stable recorded value.
//
// It is deliberately total; each step degrades to the most resolved form
// reached so far. An empty or whitespace-only input returns the empty string,
// so callers that distinguish "unset" from "mismatch" must check for empty.

// canonicalFilesystemPath is the COMPARISON normalization: absoluteFilesystemPath
// plus symlink resolution. Two paths naming the same location canonicalize to
// the same string regardless of how either was written or recorded.
//
// Symlink resolution is best effort, because comparators must be able to
// canonicalize a location that does not exist -- a recorded worktree that has
// since been removed, or a path about to be created.
//
// EvalSymlinks fails outright when the LEAF is missing, even if an ancestor is a
// symlink. Taking the absolute form in that case would make /link/x and /real/x
// canonicalize differently for a not-yet-created x, so two records naming the
// same future location would compare as drift. Instead, resolve the longest
// EXISTING ancestor and rejoin the remainder, which gives the same answer for
