// #498 U7 / HOLD 2: THE ONE DURABLE-RECORD CONTRACT.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. I wrote the publication validator as its OWN list of checks, and dev-2 found by
// source trace that it accepted records the constructor would refuse -- exactly:
//
//	a current-schema native record with scope, supervisor, pause generation, an arbitrary 64-hex
//	TransitionID, and NativeBinding = &resumeGoalNativeBinding{} with all ten interiors ZERO,
//	published at the canonical path derived from that arbitrary id.
//
// Publication accepted it. Nothing durable about that record is usable: no scanner derives that id, so the
// claim is present on disk and reads as ABSENT for the real pause, which is the double delivery claim-once
// exists to prevent -- reached through the writer I added to prevent it.
//
// THE RULED SHAPE IS ONE DECIDER, TWO CALL SITES, not a second hand-maintained list inside publication. Two
// lists of record requirements must co-evolve forever, and their drift IS the constructor-versus-publisher
// disagreement this milestone has been closing all day. With one function, a field added to the contract is
// automatically required at publication and the co-drift is structurally impossible.
//
// THE BOUNDARY (dev-2's refinement, ruled binding) is what makes the split principled rather than arbitrary:
//
//	SHARED (here)      every invariant OBSERVABLE IN THE COMPLETED RECORD: per-kind required fields, and
//	                   derived-identity RECOMPUTATION from the record's own durable source fields.
//	CONSTRUCTOR ONLY   what a finished record cannot testify about: which INPUT ROUTE a value arrived by,
//	                   Base smuggling, and fresh-copy/non-aliasing. A record on disk cannot tell you whether
//	                   its supervisor came through the explicit input or through Base.
//	PUBLICATION        this validator, then exact path/name agreement, which is about the record's LOCATION
//	                   rather than its content.
//
// IDENTITY IS RECOMPUTED, NOT COMPARED TO ITSELF. This is the sharpest part of dev-2's finding and the reason
// path-equality alone was not closure: my canonical path derivation took record.TransitionID as INPUT, so
// checking the path against it proved only that the record agreed with itself. A self-referential invariant
// binds nothing -- the same defect class as U10's runtime-resolved baseline_head, which cto rejected for
// binding the run to whatever tree it found. The identity must be derived from the fields that GENERATE it.
