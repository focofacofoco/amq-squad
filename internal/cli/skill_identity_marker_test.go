// #534 moved the skill identity out of a "Skill version: X.Y.Z" body preamble and into
// frontmatter stamped by scripts/generate-plugin-skills.py. These tests protect the two
// properties that move had to preserve: the shipped bundle still verifies, and a bundle
// that cannot be verified still WARNS rather than passing quietly.

// TestNoShippedSkillCarriesThePreamble asserts the deleted preamble is absent from EVERY
// SKILL.md, in both mirrors and in the sources they are generated from.
//
// The doctor-acceptance test below covers only the amq-squad router, because that is the
// single file the binary reads. Nothing else covers the other 13: the release validator
// requires the frontmatter version to be PRESENT, the drift gate checks that named
// commands exist, and `generate-plugin-skills.py --check` only proves mirrors match their
// sources. A preamble pasted back into one skill's source and faithfully mirrored would
// pass all three, and agents reading that skill would resume announcing a version from the
// body -- the exact behaviour #534 removed.
//
// Sources are checked as well as mirrors. Mirrors alone would be sufficient (a synced
// mirror reveals the source, and an unsynced one fails --check), but naming the source
// file points the reader at the file they would actually edit.

// TestNoGoCodeReadsTheDeletedMarker is an enumeration test derived from the tree rather

//
// Comment lines are ignored: prose explaining what was removed is documentation, not a
// consumer. Excluding them by rule rather than by an exemption list keeps this test from
// needing maintenance of its own.
//
// ACCEPTED RESIDUALS, recorded rather than chased. Any substring test can be evaded by
// string concatenation ("Skill ver" + "sion:") or by a raw string literal whose line
// happens to start with //. Both are residuals of substring matching itself, not gaps
// this test can close, and neither is a plausible accident. The failure mode this test
// exists to catch is a consumer written NORMALLY, which it does catch.

// Note also that block-comment INTERIORS are not excluded, so a marker inside /* */
// produces a false positive. That direction is deliberate: it fails loud rather than
