// PR5 / #498 U6: the OWNED DELIVERY BOUNDARY.
//
// Three properties, and each has a named failure mode:
//
//  1. THE DIRECTIVE IS DURABLE AND COMES FIRST. An audited automatic action must leave a record of
//     WHY it happened that survives the process, and it must exist BEFORE the pane is touched. After
//     is too late: a crash between input and record produces a delivery nobody can explain, which is
//     the worst outcome for an operator trying to reconstruct what an automatic system did to their
//     agent. Directive failure or unknown result therefore produces ZERO pane input.
//
//  2. THE INPUT GOES THROUGH THE OWNED ABSTRACTION, never raw send-keys. sendPromptToPane is the
//     package's pane-input seam (runtime_actions.go:247, wrapping tmuxpane.SendPromptToPane) and it
//     is what goal delivery already uses. Raw `tmux send-keys` bypasses the queueing, target
//     validation and error typing that abstraction owns -- and the error typing is load-bearing here,
//     see (3).
//
//  3. THERE ARE THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. Success, failure, and UNKNOWN. tmuxpane.QueuedInputError
//     means the input was queued but its arrival is unconfirmed: the bytes may or may not have
//     reached the pane. Collapsing that into either success or failure is the double-delivery bug --
//     treated as failure a retry could deliver twice, treated as success a lost resume looks
//     completed. It is returned as its own typed condition so the executor leaves the reservation
//     INDETERMINATE and no automatic path retries.

// supervisionDirectivePublisher records the durable audit directive. Injected so the
// directive-failure and directive-unknown falsifiers are expressible; production supplies the real
// publisher.

// supervisionProductionDirectivePublisher is the DURABLE audit directive, on the canonical owned path.

// send, runOwnedDurableSend executes it and persists a receipt under .amq-squad/receipts/ with
// at-most-once semantics. That receipt IS the audit property U6 requires -- a record of why an
// automatic action happened that survives the process.
//
// THE SUPERVISOR IS THE SENDER, NEVER THE OPERATOR. The supervisor is the authorizing identity under
// U1, and sending this as the operator would attribute an automatic action to a human who did not
// take it -- the impersonation amq.go explicitly refuses. So `from` is the supervisor and the thread
// is the canonical p2p pair between the supervisor and the resumed agent, derived through
// receiptCanonicalP2P so the ordering matches every other thread in the system rather than being
// composed by hand here.
//
// A RECEIPT THAT CANNOT PERSIST IS A FAILED DIRECTIVE. durableFinalReceiptPersistError is returned as
// an error, not swallowed: an unpersisted receipt means the audit record does not durably exist, and
// property (1) says no pane input happens without one. This is the branch that makes

//
//   - REPLAY PROTECTION IS CLAIM-ONCE, NOT THIS RETURN VALUE. The stale version of this comment said
//     surfacing a bookkeeping failure "invites a retry that would deliver a second audited resume". That
//     is false: a consumed claim BLOCKS re-entry at the claim-once gate, so no automatic retry reaches
//     delivery. I corrected this in the executor and left this copy standing -- fixing one instance of a
//     claim and leaving another is its own recurring defect.
//   - THE REAL REASON IS CONFLATION. Callers read a returned error as "the action failed". Here the
//     action SUCCEEDED and only its bookkeeping did not, so an ordinary error would make a completed,
//     irreversible delivery indistinguishable from one that never happened.
//
// Nor are the errors discarded any more: they travel in supervisionResumeOutcome and surface as operator
// warnings. Failure never authorizes replay AND failure evidence never disappears.
